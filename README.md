# Spam Email Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains a project focused on spam email detection using deep learning models. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the SMS Spam Collection, which consists of SMS messages tagged as either legitimate (ham) or spam.

## Dataset Context

The SMS Spam Collection dataset comprises 5,574 SMS messages in English. Each message is accompanied by a label (ham or spam) and the raw text of the message. The dataset was compiled from various sources, including a collection of 425 SMS spam messages from the Grumbletext website, a subset of 3,375 randomly chosen ham messages from the NUS SMS Corpus, 450 SMS ham messages from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis, and the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big, which contains 1,002 ham messages and 322 spam messages.

## Project Structure

The project involves the implementation and evaluation of three different models for spam email detection:

1. **Deep Learning Model**
2. **Bidirectional LSTM Model**
3. **USE Encoder Model**

Each model is trained and tested on the SMS Spam Collection dataset, and their results, including accuracy metrics, are documented for comparison.

## Results

The results and accuracies of each model are outlined in the project documentation. The performance metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of each model in classifying SMS messages as ham or spam.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/MadanBabu1314114/Spam-Email-Detection-Using-DL.git
cd Spam-Email-Detection-Using-DL
```

2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks and scripts in the project for model implementation, training, and evaluation.
